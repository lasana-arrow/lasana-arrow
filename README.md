- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olga. You can call me Lasana @lasna-arrow
- ðŸ‘€ I'm going to hold some WordPress scripts or other scripts here not to lose them
- ðŸŒ± I make websites with different CMS, but I like WordPress most of all. I write on PHP, JavaScript and now I'm learning Python to see if it is better for writing Telegram bots then other languages (as people say)
- ðŸ“« You can write me to sagittarius.group@gmail.com or lasana.arrow@yandex.ru
